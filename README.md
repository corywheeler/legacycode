# Working Effectively With Legacy Code

### A place to practice and hopefully master the wisdom Michael Feathers published in his book

One of my favorite practices that we do in the dev group at [VersionOne](http://versionone.com) is book club. Our latest club is over Working Effectively With Legacy Code by Michael Feathers. It's a book that I've started several times, and this time I'm intent on finishing it. I greatly appreciate what he has put out, and I have no doubt it will aid me in becomming a more thoughtful developer.

When I read technical books, my fingers have to do the walking to help me to drive what I'm reading deeper into muscle memory. To aid in that effort, I've created this repo to hold the code that I play with while learning.

The project is set up to be a C# project using NUnit as the testing framework.

I have created the master branch to hold basic things necessary for anyone. Things like, a solution, and a project to hold the tests, as well as the inclusion of NUnit via NuGet.

Beyond that, all of my work will exist in a [branch with my name on it](https://github.com/corywheeler/legacycode/tree/corywheeler).
